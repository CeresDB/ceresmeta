# Style Guide
CeresMeta is written in Golang so the basic code style we adhere to is the [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

Besides the [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments), there are also some custom rules for the project:
- Error Handling
- Logging
